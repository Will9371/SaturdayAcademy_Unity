 Resources for further practice:
 Jimmy Vegas: long-form tutorials for the absolute beginner
 Brakeys: fast-paced, engaging short tutorials on a wide range of topics.
 Holistic3D: long-form tutorials on complex topics like shader programming, machine learning, and procedural terrain
 (note: much of this instructor's content is on Udemy, which is cheap but not free)
 Gabriel Aguilar Prod: master of visual effects with particle systems

Non-Unity:
Jamie King: run across some confusing syntax (like <T>)? Go here for simple yet deep explanations
Christopher Okhravi (see especially the Design Patterns series): the stuff they teach in college CS classes...but free!
Note: many of the concepts taught here are built into Unity so you don't have to think about them, but it is good stuff 
to know if you want to program outside of game development or are curious about how the Unity Engine was built.
